    <h1>Privacy Policy for Brownie Extension</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: <span id="date"></span></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how the Brownie browser extension ("we",
      "our", or "the extension") handles information when you use our extension.
      We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about
      our data practices.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      The Brownie extension is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal
      information necessary for the extension to function:
    </p>

    <h3>2.1 Local Storage Data</h3>
    <p>
      The extension stores the following data locally on your device using
      IndexedDB:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Network Request Data:</strong> When using the DevTools panel
        feature, the extension stores network request information including
        URLs, HTTP methods, request/response headers, status codes, and response
        bodies. This data is only collected when you have Chrome DevTools open
        and is used solely for displaying network requests in the DevTools
        panel.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tab Information:</strong> For the DevTools panel, the extension
        stores basic tab information (URL and title) to associate network
        requests with specific tabs. This information is used only for
        organizing network requests in the DevTools interface.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Tab Information (Temporary Access)</h3>
    <p>
      When you click the extension icon on an arXiv page, the extension
      temporarily accesses:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The current tab's URL (to identify arXiv paper pages)</li>
      <li>The current tab's title (to generate appropriate PDF filenames)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is accessed only when you explicitly click the extension
      icon and is used immediately to construct the PDF download URL. It is not
      stored, logged, or transmitted anywhere.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>The extension uses collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>PDF Downloads:</strong> To download PDF files from arXiv.org and
        alphaxiv.org with properly formatted filenames based on paper titles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>DevTools Panel:</strong> To display network request information
        in the custom DevTools panel for debugging and development purposes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>
      All data collected by the extension is stored exclusively on your device
      using the browser's IndexedDB storage system. We do not transmit, upload,
      or sync any data to external servers.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Network Request Data:</strong> Stored locally and automatically
        cleaned up after 24 hours of inactivity. You can manually clear this
        data at any time through the DevTools panel interface.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tab Information:</strong> Stored locally and automatically
        cleaned up when tabs are closed or after 24 hours of inactivity.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
      <strong
        >We do not share, sell, or transmit any data to third parties.</strong
      >
      All data remains on your device and is never sent to external servers,
      analytics services, or any other third-party services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extension only accesses external websites (arXiv.org and alphaxiv.org)
      to download PDF files when you explicitly initiate a download. These
      downloads are performed directly in your browser, and no information about
      your downloads is transmitted to us or any third party.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Permissions Explanation</h2>
    <p>The extension requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Host Permissions (https://*/*):</strong> Required to download
        PDF files from arXiv.org and alphaxiv.org. The extension only accesses
        these specific domains when you initiate a download.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Storage:</strong> Required to store network request data locally
        for the DevTools panel feature.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>DevTools:</strong> Required to create a custom DevTools panel
        for network request monitoring.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tabs:</strong> Required to read the current tab's URL and title
        when you click the extension icon to download PDFs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ActiveTab:</strong> Required to communicate with the content
        script in the active tab to initiate PDF downloads.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Control</h2>
    <p>You have full control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can clear all stored network request data at any time through the
        DevTools panel interface.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can uninstall the extension at any time, which will remove all
        locally stored data.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can disable the extension without uninstalling it, which will
        prevent any data collection.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take data security seriously. All data is stored locally on your device
      using the browser's built-in secure storage mechanisms. We do not transmit
      any data over the network, which eliminates the risk of data interception
      or unauthorized access during transmission.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We
      do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If
      you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with
      personal information, please contact us so we can delete such information.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
      any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.
      We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay
      informed about how we protect your information.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      This extension is designed to comply with applicable privacy laws and
      regulations, including but not limited to the General Data Protection
      Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Since we
      do not collect, process, or transmit personal data to external servers,
      the extension operates with minimal privacy impact.
